      "act_summary": "A Prologue introduces the play as a story of real events. The Duke of Buckingham, along with some other nobles, discuss the meeting between King Henry and the French King. They discuss the peace agreement made between them and how it has already been broken. Buckingham expresses his concerns (and criticisms) about the amount of power held by Cardinal Wolsey, the Lord Chancellor of England. During this same discussion, Buckingham is unexpectedly arrested (kind of proving his point). He goes to jail for treason. At court, King Henry makes policy decisions about the woollen trade, along with his wife, Queen Katherine. Wolsey takes the credit for the King's decisions. Katherine questions his motives. While Henry agrees to this criticism, when the Queen also speaks on behalf of Buckingham, the King refuses to hear it and orders his trial.",
