The French king, Philip, sent the ambassador to claim the English throne on behalf of John’s nephew, Prince Arthur. Philip himself is interested in and supportive of Arthur's claim to the throne. John and Eleanor reject the embassy, and France threatens war. Shortly afterwards, Robert and Philip Faulconbridge come to the King to settle their family inheritance dispute. There is confusion in the inheritance law as Philip is older but is an illegitimate child. During their discussion, Eleanor claims that Philip is the bastard son of John’s late brother, Richard Coeur-de-lion (Lionheart). Philip decides to let go of his Faulconbridge inheritance in favour of joining Queen Eleanor’s army to France. He is given knighthood and the title Sir Richard. His mother, Lady Faulconbridge, arrives to defend her honour. But she privately admits that Richard Coeur-de-lion was Philip's father.",
