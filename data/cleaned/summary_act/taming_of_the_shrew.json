After the ceremony, he immediately leaves for Verona with his new wife.",

Eventually, worn down by her husband's behaviour, Katherina submits and agrees to all Petruccio's whims. In exchange, she has his permission to visit her father in Padua. On the journey, the couple meet Vincentio, Lucentio's wealthy father. Petruccio tests Kate's obedience, asking her to say that the sun is the moon and that an old man is a beautiful young woman.",
    "act_5": "The three eventually reach Padua. Hortensio, rejected by Bianca, has already married a wealthy widow. They also find that Tranio, still dressed as Lucentio, has succeeded in convincing Baptista to let Lucentio marry Bianca.

When the real Vincentio arrives and discovers a pedant posing as him and Tranio in his son's clothes, Lucentio is forced to confess to the whole plan. He tells them about his new marriage to Bianca."
