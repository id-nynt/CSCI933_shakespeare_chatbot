  "acts": {
    "act_1": "In the French kingdom of Navarre, King Ferdinand and his three companions, Biron (or Berowne), Dumaine, and Longueville (or Longaville), see themselves as enthusiastic students of philosophy. Together, they resolve to forgo the company of women for three years to devote time to their studies. Additionally, this decree against women applies to the entire kingdom. When the local peasant Costard is caught pursuing his betrothed, Jacquenetta, he is arrested. The Spaniard Don Armado, the one in charge of punishing Costard, is also in love with Jacquenetta. He writes her a letter for Costard to deliver.",
    "act_4": "The King and his friends watch each other in hiding as they separately declare their love for the Princess and her ladies. They soon find out about everyone's affections. After his letter is revealed, Biron persuades Navarre that love is a lawful part of their studies. The men decide to continue to entertain their guests.",
    "act_5": "The men try to woo the women with gifts and visit them in disguise. But they still pretend to be indifferent to the ladies' charms. Finally, the women trick them (through the women's own disguises) into an admission of the truth of their love: King Ferdinand for the Princess, Biron for Rosaline, Dumaine for Katharine, Longueville for Maria. The men and women come together happily to watch the pageant of the 'Nine Worthies'. During the performance, a messenger arrives to say that the King of France is dead. Because of this news, the Princess decides that she must return home. She declares a year-long period of absence between the men of Navarre and the women of France. If, at the end of that time, their promises hold true, then the ladies may return to accept them in marriage. The play ends as the ladies leave, and the pageant actors sing."
