The Duke of Buckingham, along with some other nobles, discuss the meeting between King Henry and the French King. They discuss the peace agreement made between them and how it has already been broken. Buckingham expresses his concerns (and criticisms) about the amount of power held by Cardinal Wolsey, the Lord Chancellor of England. During this same discussion, Buckingham is unexpectedly arrested (kind of proving his point). He goes to jail for treason. At court, King Henry makes policy decisions about the woollen trade, along with his wife, Queen Katherine. Wolsey takes the credit for the King's decisions. Katherine questions his motives. While Henry agrees to this criticism, when the Queen also speaks on behalf of Buckingham, the King refuses to hear it and orders his trial.",

John and Eleanor reject the embassy, and France threatens war. Shortly afterwards, Robert and Philip Faulconbridge come to the King to settle their family inheritance dispute. There is confusion in the inheritance law as Philip is older but is an illegitimate child. During their discussion, Eleanor claims that Philip is the bastard son of John’s late brother, Richard Coeur-de-lion (Lionheart). Philip decides to let go of his Faulconbridge inheritance in favour of joining Queen Eleanor’s army to France. He is given knighthood and the title Sir Richard. His mother, Lady Faulconbridge, arrives to defend her honour. But she privately admits that Richard Coeur-de-lion was Philip's father.",

Silvia is also captured by the outlaws while Sir Eglamour escapes. The Duke and Thurio take Proteus (followed by Julia/Sebastian) in pursuit of Silvia. When they find her with the outlaws, Proteus rescues her. Despite Silvia's protests, Proteus attempts to force himself on her, but Valentine stops him, as leader of the outlaws. Julia overhears the young men's argument and their eventual reconciliation. Mistaking Valentine's apparent wish to give Silvia to Proteus, Julia faints in front of them. Proteus recognises the ring she carries as the one he gave to Julia. She reveals her identity, and Proteus's love for Julia is revived. The outlaws arrive with their captives, the Duke and Thurio. Thurio denies Silvia in response to threats from Valentine. Valentine's attachment to Silvia is rewarded by the Duke's approval. The two pairs of lovers agree to share a wedding day. The play ends as the Duke gives a free pardon to the outlaws at Valentine's request.",

Soon afterwards, Titus returns from war with five prisoners: Tamora, queen of the Goths, her three sons, and Aaron the Moor. Titus sacrifices Tamora’s eldest son despite his mother’s pleas, as part of a burial ritual for his own sons. Titus is then offered the throne but rejects the chance to be emperor because he is too old. However, he offers his support to Saturninus. He presents Tamora and her two remaining sons to Saturninus, who is now Emperor. Saturninus decides to claim Lavinia (Titus' daughter) as his wife. His brother Bassianus opposes this as he is already in love with and betrothed to Lavinia. Lavinia’s brother Mutius attempts to help her, but Titus, angered by this, kills his son Mutius. Despite this, Saturninus then decides that he would prefer Tamora as his empress. He liberates her and her remaining sons, along with Aaron the Moor, Tamora's lover. After a bitter argument, Titus agrees that Mutius may be buried in the Andronici tomb.",
